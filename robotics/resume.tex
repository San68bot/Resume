\item{\underline{\textbf{Smart Signal}}}: \textit{C/C++ $\vert$ Microcontrollers} \hfill {Aug 2017 - Dec 2017} \vspace{0.25em} \\
{Developed an intelligent traffic intersection prototype that utilized ultrasonic sensors to optimize green light allocation, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and improved system efficiency. Recognized for successfully integrating hardware and software solutions to solve real-world problems with innovative technology.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{Asynchronous Finite State Machines Builder}}}: \textit{Logical Control Flow} \hfill {Jan 2022 - Apr 2023} \vspace{0.25em} \\
{An extremely robust software library, I created and rigorously tested, to make creating and modeling Finite State Machines easy. Its potential to be embedded into any software system is made possible by a unique plug-and-play style interface. This system efficiently transitions between program states while preserving context variables.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{Dynamic Sensor Localization}}}: \textit{Signal Processing $\vert$ Sensor Fusion $\vert$ Localization} \hfill {May 2022 - Jun 2023} \vspace{0.25em}\\
{Intuitive software algorithm I created, that polls ultrasonic pulses to fixed objects to derive a relative real-time 2d vector position. The algorithm efficiently polls sensors on an "as needed" basis, which significantly increases system responsiveness. Additionally, any outliers in data that is polled are intelligently filtered out.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{Environmental Safety Navigation}}}: \textit{Computer Vision $\vert$ AI $\vert$ Neural Networks $\vert$ vSLAM} \hfill {Oct 2023 - Present} \vspace{0.25em}\\
{Developed real-time AI technology for visually impaired individuals, combining computer vision with haptic feedback for seamless navigation in various environments. Implemented a custom object detection system with a rolling window noise dampening filter, ensuring accurate tracking of nearby objects. All processing is on-device for enhanced privacy and compatibility with smartphones and cameras.}
