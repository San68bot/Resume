\vspace{-1.25em}
\item{\underline{\textbf{Smart Signal}}}: \textit{C/C++ $\vert$ Arduino} \hfill {Aug 2017 - Dec 2017}\vspace{0.25em} \\
{I created a dynamic traffic intersection simulation, using ultrasonic sensors to prioritize the busiest lane for the green light, reducing traffic congestion and wait times. This project gained recognition for seamlessly integrating hardware and software solutions, highlighting my proficiency in addressing practical problems through innovative technology.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{3D Projectile Motion Simulator}}}: \textit{Python $\vert$ Physics} \hfill {Sep 2020 - Jan 2021}\vspace{0.25em} \\
{Created a software that could estimate the necessary variables to launch an object a specified distance. This program derived velocity(could be translated into motor power), launch angle, and flight duration while accounting for environmental influences. Could also simulate the projectile in 3D to simulate position at any given time.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{AlphaGo Finite State Machine Builder}}}: \textit{Finite State Machine $\vert$ Software Library} \hfill {Jan 2022 - Apr 2023}\vspace{0.25em} \\
{An extremely robust software library designed to make the creation and analysis of Finite State Machines as easy as possible. Its potential to be embedded into any system is made possible by a "Plug-and-Play" style interface.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{Multi-Sensor Fusion Localization}}}: \textit{Live Location Estimation $\vert$ Sensor Fusion} \hfill {May 2022 - Jun 2023} \vspace{0.25em}\\
{Software library that uses distances to nearby fixed objects to derive a robot's relative real-time position (x, y, $\theta$). Additionally, it can communicate with sensors to retrieve readings at optimal times as needed.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{AlphaLib Robot Software Library}}}: \textit{Trajectory Generation \& Following $\vert$ OpenCV} \hfill {Jun 2021 - Jun 2023} \vspace{0.25em}\\
{An all-in-one software package that makes programming any FTC robot easier and highly efficient. Several control theory concepts are skillfully implemented, such as Trajectory Generation \& Following, Open(FeedForward) \& Closed(PID) Loop Controllers, and Object Classification.}
