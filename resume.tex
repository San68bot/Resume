\vspace{-1.25em}
\item{\underline{\textbf{Smart Signal}}}: \textit{C/C++ $\vert$ Arduino} \hfill {Aug 2017 - Dec 2017} \vspace{0.25em} \\
{I created an intelligent traffic intersection prototype, using ultrasonic sensors to dynamically prioritize the green light to the busiest lane, ultimately reducing traffic and making the traffic light system more efficient. This project gained recognition for seamlessly integrating hardware and software solutions to address practical problems through innovative technology.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{Finite State Machine Builder}}}: \textit{Finite State Machines} \hfill {Jan 2022 - Apr 2023} \vspace{0.25em} \\
{An extremely robust software library, I created and rigorously tested, to make creating and modeling Finite State Machines easy. Its potential to be embedded into any software system is made possible by a unique plug-and-play style interface. This system efficiently transitions between program states while preserving context variables.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{Dynamic Sensor Localization}}}: \textit{Real-World Localization $\vert$ Sensor Fusion} \hfill {May 2022 - Jun 2023} \vspace{0.25em}\\
{Intuitive software algorithm I created, that polls ultrasonic pulses to fixed objects to derive a relative real-time 2d vector position. The algorithm efficiently polls sensors on an "as needed" basis, which significantly increases system responsiveness. Additionally, any outliers in data that is polled are intelligently filtered out.}

\item{\underline{\textbf{AlphaLib Robot Software Library}}}: \textit{Control Systems $\vert$ Trajectory Generation} \hfill {Jun 2021 - Jun 2023} \vspace{0.25em}\\
{An all-in-one software package I designed, that makes programming FTC robots easier and highly efficient. Several control theory concepts are skillfully implemented, such as Trajectory Generation \& Following, Open \& Closed Loop Control Systems, Object Classification, Logic Controllers, and Systems Programming.}
